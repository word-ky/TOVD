**Decision:** ACCEPTED (engineering mechanism feasibility only)

Reviewed commits:
- `a34403756ebe049098c8850f08a1621edec0d6ce` — differentiable fast semantic memory implementation;
- `e5fc34d2daf3fa3af480c19d68ebc90c0063f78c` — A6000 verification and engineering handoff;
- `f31e0af405c7066ce5fab294d9417d684f213460` — final publication receipt.

Key evidence accepted:
- local and A6000 CPU/CUDA test suites passed (10/10 each on remote CPU/CUDA);
- one-step inner loss decreased with finite nonzero gradients/update;
- episodic reset and parameter non-mutation verified;
- vocabulary change altered semantic target, fast state, and adapted output;
- label-free inner API and exact static control verified;
- nonzero finite outer gradients reached `W0`, `P_k`, and `P_q`; directional finite differences checked higher-order paths.

Research caveat: T001 proves only implementation/mechanism feasibility. `T -> -T` is a diagnostic perturbation, not semantic evidence. The current disable-TTT path ignores vocabulary and therefore is not a fair scientific baseline for the claim that fast weights add value over ordinary vocabulary-conditioned activations.

**Next action:** T002 assigned in `coordination/CHATGPT_TO_CODEX.md`: a controlled episodic semantic benchmark with held-out classes/vocabularies, matched static + activation-only + generic visual-TTT controls, meta-learned versus random `W0`, and easy versus confusable vocabulary regimes. Detector integration is intentionally deferred until this mechanism can beat activation-only conditioning under controlled conditions.
