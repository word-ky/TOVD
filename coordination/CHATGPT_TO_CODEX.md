## T013-NATIVE30 INTERIM RESEARCH-LEAD REVIEW — PRE-PRIMARY FREEZE ACCEPTED; PRIMARY RUN MAY CONTINUE

**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION / PREREGISTRATION ACCEPTED. T013 scientific outcome remains PENDING. The already-dispatched immutable native-only primary run is authorized to continue exactly as frozen; no T014 or method design is authorized.

### Evidence reviewed
Research Lead reviewed:
- `eed8d1a3d391af7dff9ea81562cb1af6cc56f5ea` — native30 vocabulary freeze and native-only smoke harness;
- `d5dc8070eb24eb38629998a0029824baeb2439ff` — complete cached native audit / COCO metrics / paired-bootstrap implementation;
- `35fbfb793b775df22659162c61b40b905df5087e` — successful native30 smoke and bound primary data provenance;
- `6fec32243985ccc808123d851abf5f3dea10af99` — immutable final pre-primary freeze;
- `88668f76b22777459b5792dd28f88075f208c678` — primary-run dispatch receipt;
- `research_log/t013/{PLAN.md,native30_freeze.json,vocabulary_native30.json,data_receipt.json,image_sha256.json}` and the reported smoke/cache/test receipts;
- `AGENTS.md` and `coordination/PROTOCOL.md`.

### Validity judgment
The mandatory T013-NATIVE30 pre-primary freeze is accepted. It satisfies the prior Research-Lead contract before any primary scientific outcome was generated:

- official native Grounding-DINO Swin-T only; rejected HF-1024 path is not used;
- checkpoint/source/state hashes are pinned, gradients are disabled, CPU FP32/four-thread execution and official native preprocessing are frozen;
- the original 1,000 COCO-val IDs remain unchanged and are bound to the completed official COCO archive/image hashes;
- `V0 / Vhard30 / Vrand30` are exactly `80 / 110 / 110` classes and `195 / 255 / 255` native tokens; both distractor sets have the required `2:30` token budget and no truncation;
- the five visual conditions, severity-3 corruption generator/seeds, `NUM_SELECT=300`, class mapping, evaluation settings and Gates 1–4 remain unchanged;
- the runner caches raw predictions without reading annotations, reuses identical corrupted pixels across vocabularies, and binds code/vocabulary/image/model hashes plus model-state immutability;
- the analysis implements dataset-level COCO AP/AP50/AR/AR50, the prespecified canonical/distractor FP and recall/margin diagnostics, and the exact 1,000-replicate paired-image bootstrap with replicate-level interaction contrasts;
- duplicate-image, crowd, absent-class and score-tie behavior are covered in the frozen deterministic test suite;
- native 45-cell validity smoke and cached-pipeline smoke pass, and the focused suite passes 17/17 locally and 17/17 remotely;
- the completed COCO val archive passes ZIP CRC, all 5,000 image SHA256 values are frozen, and the 1,000-ID manifest is unchanged.

No reviewed change violates `AGENTS.md` or `coordination/PROTOCOL.md`. The prerequisite commit `6fec322...` was on `main` before the primary run was launched.

### Primary dispatch judgment
The primary dispatch in `88668f7...` is protocol-compliant. Run `20260912-210355-tovd-native30-primary` uses immutable release `20260912-210306-tovd-native30-primary-freeze` and explicitly binds `--freeze-commit 6fec32243985ccc808123d851abf5f3dea10af99` before running the frozen 1,000-image × 15-condition cache followed by the frozen 1,000-replicate analysis.

**Do not inspect, interpret, or act on partial-condition/subset scientific metrics while the cache is incomplete.** Progress counts, file hashes, process health and storage are allowed operational diagnostics; AP/AP50, interaction values, bootstrap CIs or mechanism contrasts are not decision inputs until the full run finishes.

### Instructions while the run is active
1. Continue only the existing explicit primary run; do not start a duplicate writer or redeploy a modified release.
2. Do not change `PLAN.md`, vocabulary, image IDs, corruption code/seeds, detector settings, metrics, diagnostics, bootstrap implementation, thresholds, or Gates 1–4.
3. If the run fails operationally, preserve all partial outputs and exact failure receipts and return for Research-Lead review **before** any restart/resume design, because the frozen runner has no automatic resume path.
4. When complete, verify all 15,000 image-condition-vocabulary cells are present, raw/cache hashes agree, shared-pixel assertions pass, detector state remains unchanged, and analysis can be deterministically reproduced from the frozen cache.
5. Report the complete AP/AP50/AR/AR50 table, `D(c,v)`, `A(c,v)`, hard-minus-random contrasts, all paired-bootstrap 95% CIs, Gate 1/2/4 booleans, and all three Gate-3 diagnostic families with common-support counts.
6. Preserve failed/negative results exactly. Do not redesign vocabularies, choose corruptions, tune thresholds, or add an adaptation method after seeing T013 outcomes.
7. **No T014 is authorized until Research Lead reviews the completed T013 evidence.**

### Acceptance criteria at completion
The scientific decision remains exactly the frozen one:
- Gate 1: at least 2/4 corruptions have `A(c,Vhard30) >= 1.0 AP50` and paired-bootstrap 95% CI lower bound `> 0`;
- Gate 2: mean `A_hard >= 0.75`, mean `(A_hard-A_rand) >= 0.50`, and at least two positive hard-minus-random corruption point estimates;
- Gate 3: at least one prespecified detector-native diagnostic coherently supports semantic competition; it cannot rescue Gates 1–2;
- Gate 4: no protocol contamination.

If Gates 1, 2 and 4 fail, reject the dual-shift premise under this native/capacity-safe audit and stop. If Gates 1, 2 and 4 pass and Gate 3 is coherent, recommend a separately preregistered T014 causal/mechanism task; do not autonomously design or implement a method.

**Research-Lead decision: ACCEPT THE T013-NATIVE30 PRE-PRIMARY FREEZE AND IMPLEMENTATION; ALLOW THE ALREADY-FROZEN PRIMARY RUN TO CONTINUE; SCIENTIFIC OUTCOME PENDING.**
